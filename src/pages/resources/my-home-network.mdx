This post aims to document how I manage my home network.

# ISP setup

## Cabonnet

### MAC address cloning

Cabonnet requires the MAC address of the device connected to the ONU to be previously registered.

## Vivo

### MitraStar HGU

#### Proper bridge mode

Read [How to setup the Vivo MitraStar modem in bridge mode without losing TV and Phone services]( {getRelativeLocaleUrl("/resources/vivo-mitrastar-bridge/") }).

## Claro

### CGNAT removal

Claro uses CGNAT by default, which makes it impossible to host services. To remove it, one must call their support and ask "I'm 'natted' and I'd like a rollback to open ports to access my IP cameras out of home".

# IP addressing

## Subnetting

I manage a `10.0.0.0/8` network as I have several subnets due to hierarchical addressing.

My network is divided as follows:

10.x.y.z

- x: site number:
  - 0: Core
  - Other sites have their numbers allocated sequentially, starting at 1
- y: network number
  - 1: Core
  - 2: VPN
  - 3: IoT
  - 4: Guest
- z: host number
  - 1: Gateway
  - 2: Main server
  - Other devices have their IPs allocated sequentially starting at 3
  - All known devices have a static IP and DNS entry

The Core site has a public IP and no ports are blocked by the ISP. If needed, it can work as a reverse proxy for services hosted on other sites.

All trusted devices, such as PCs, servers, and secure IoT hubs and devices (Apple TV) are on the Core network.

IoT and Guest networks isolate clients from talking to each other but still provide access to the internet. If WAN access blocking is needed, it's done on the network's firewall.

A mDNS reflector runs on the Core network to allow devices on different subnets to discover each other when needed.

# VLAN tagging

# Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN)

I use the `yudi.me` domain for all my network-related services. All devices have a DNS entry with their FQDN in the format `device.site.yudi.me`.

# Site to site VPN

All my sites are interconnected using WireGuard VPN. The Core site has a public IP and acts as the VPN server. All other sites have a WireGuard client running on a Raspberry Pi.

# Wireless networks

I use generic names for my networks for simplicity:

- Core: Wi-Fi [site]
- IoT: Wi-Fi [site] IoT
- Guest: Wi-Fi [site] Guest

Adding the site name avoids collisions as "Wi-Fi" can be a common SSID.

All networks use WPA3-SAE, except for the IoT network, which uses WPA2-PSK/WPA3-SAE for better compatibility with devices that no longer receive updates.

# Wishlist

These are the things I'd like to implement on my network in the future:

- M2M
  - SIMs are only available to enterprises
- IPv6 subnetting
  - /56 prefixes are only available to enterprises
- Own ONU
  - Some ISPs make this very difficult
  - All ONUs provided by my ISPs have been good so far
